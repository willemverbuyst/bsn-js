# Contributing

When it comes to open source, there are different ways you can contribute, all
of which are valuable.

## Initial steps

Before you start working on a contribution, create an issue describing what you want to build. It's possible someone else is already working on something similar, or perhaps there is a reason that feature isn't implemented. The maintainers will point you in the right direction.

## Development

The following steps will get you setup to contribute changes to this repo:

1. Fork this repo.

2. Clone your forked repo: `git clone git@github.com:{your_username}/bsn-js.git`

3. Run `npm i` to install dependencies.

4. Create a new branch off the `development` branch: `git checkout -b your-feature-name`

5. Push your branch to the repo: `git push origin your-feature-name`

6. Create PR with description of what you have done and how to test it.

7. Submit the PR. The maintainers will follow up ASAP.
